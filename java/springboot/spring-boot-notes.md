# Spring boot

- Setting up spring for production ready was difficult:
  - Dependency Management: Manage dependencies and versions in pom.xml
  - Configure .xml for spring framework
  - Define and manage spring configuration
  - Manual implementation of NFR -> logging, error handling, monitoring
- Creating a spring boot project from spring initializer
  - group -> package name
  - artifact -> class

## REST API
